# Pacman with Voice AI
Pacman in JS for voice AI tutorial

This repo is for those wishing to complete my tutorial on how to implement A.I voice commands into a JavaScript game of Pacman using [Alan AI](http://voice.alan.app/AniaKubowJavaScriptGames).

IMPORTANT: When working with Alan A.I's SDK Keys, please hide your Key and do not publish onto GitHub or share on the internet. This project is for your own local use only and not to be published onto your GitHub with your Key visible to others. You Don't want to end up like this [poor person](https://medium.com/@morgannegagne/a-very-expensive-aws-mistake-56a3334ed9ad). This is advise for your own benefit. You can hide your Key by converting this project to use packages such as .dotenv.
